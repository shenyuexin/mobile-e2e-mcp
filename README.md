> AI-safe mobile device control via MCP: a policy-guarded, session-oriented mobile automation harness for AI agents, with deterministic-first Android/iOS execution, bounded visual fallback, and evidence-rich outcomes.

This repository is a pnpm monorepo that combines MCP tooling, adapter execution, and architecture docs for AI agents that need to inspect, act on, and debug mobile apps without turning raw device commands into ungoverned side effects.

## Quick Start

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobile-e2e-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@shenyuexin/mobile-e2e-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once installed, you get **66 MCP tools** for governed mobile automation, plus a built-in **Explorer** for automatic page traversal.

## Core Wedge: Governed Agent Control

The strongest use case for this project is not "replace every mobile E2E framework." It is: give an AI agent a safer control plane for mobile devices.

Compared with a thin `adb` or platform-command wrapper, this harness adds:

- **Policy boundaries**: actions are checked against policy profiles before execution.
- **Auditable sessions**: actions run inside session, lease, audit, and evidence context.
- **Capability disclosure**: agents can query supported platforms and boundaries before acting.
- **Structured outcomes**: failures, denials, and evidence are machine-consumable instead of log-only.

Reproduce the dry-run proof:

```bash
pnpm run proof:governed-agent-mobile-control
```

The proof writes a timestamped bundle under `output/showcase/governed-agent-mobile-control/<run-id>/` and verifies that a read-only session blocks an interactive action with structured `POLICY_DENIED`. See [Governed Agent Mobile Control Proof](docs/showcase/governed-agent-mobile-control.md).

## Explorer: Automatic Page Traversal

Explorer is a DFS-based automatic page traversal engine built into the MCP server. It systematically navigates through your app's screens, builds a state graph, and produces structured coverage reports without requiring manual flow definitions.

```bash
npx -y @shenyuexin/mobile-e2e-mcp@latest explore \
  --app-id com.example.app \
  --platform android \
  --output ./explore-report
```

Key features:

- **DFS-based traversal**: systematically explores every reachable screen from a starting point
- **State graph tracking**: records visited states and detects cycles to avoid infinite loops
- **Circuit breaker**: automatically stops when exploration hits diminishing returns or configured limits
- **Structured coverage reports**: outputs machine-consumable reports showing which screens and elements were discovered
- **Rule-based gating**: respects skip-page, skip-element, sampling, and risk-gating rules for safe exploration
- **Experimental horizontal fallback**: after vertical segments are exhausted, Explorer can probe horizontally scrollable content with bounded page-identity checks

### Output

Explorer produces a directory of structured artifacts:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tree.txt` | ASCII tree of all discovered pages and navigation paths |
| `report.md` | Human-readable coverage report with module breakdown |
| `failure-review.md` | Human-readable failure triage with grouped patterns and suggested next actions |
| `failure-review.json` | Machine-consumable failure triage summary |
| `summary.json` | Machine-consumable metrics and page metadata |
| `config.json` | Runtime configuration and rule settings used for the run |

Example output from a real run against iOS Settings (181 pages, max depth 5):

- [`tree.txt`](docs/showcase/explorer/tree.txt) — full page hierarchy
- [`report.md`](docs/showcase/explorer/report.md) — module breakdown and paths
- [`summary.json`](docs/showcase/explorer/summary.json) — metrics and metadata

## What This Repository Actually Is

This repo contains both:

1. **Executable implementation** (MCP server, adapters, contracts, core orchestration), and
2. **Architecture and delivery knowledge base** (design principles, capability model, phased rollout docs).

If you only remember one thing: this project is designed as a **governed mobile control layer for AI agents**, not a single-framework test runner.

## Mobile E2E Harness Positioning

This project is an **AI mobile E2E harness**: a policy-aware, session-oriented, deterministic-first execution harness for mobile automation where an AI agent needs controlled action, evidence, and support-boundary clarity.

If you're searching for terms like **mobile test harness**, **real-device Android test harness**, **AI automation harness**, or **mobile CI harness**, this repository is built for that exact workflow.

### Why teams use this harness

- **Deterministic-first harness**: stable selectors and structured retries before OCR/CV fallback
- **Failure-intelligence harness**: reason codes, evidence artifacts, and remediation suggestions
- **Governance-aware harness**: policy profiles, auditable sessions, and controlled tool surfaces
- **Explorer harness**: DFS-based automatic page traversal with state graph, circuit breaker, and structured coverage reports *(available via CLI)*
- **Real-device evidence**: Explorer/probe artifacts plus historical videos for happy path and interruption recovery

## FAQ

### What is a mobile E2E harness for AI agents?

It is an execution layer that lets AI agents run mobile test actions safely and reproducibly. This harness adds session control, policy boundaries, deterministic action routing, and structured evidence beyond basic command execution.

### Can this harness run on real Android devices?

Yes. Current real-device evidence is centered on Explorer/probe artifacts, with historical showcase scripts under `scripts/legacy/dev/*` and recordings under `docs/showcase/*`. The latest Android Vivo probe verified the core Settings UI action path and `resume_interrupted_action` with `native_android`; a few diagnostic/negative-path checks remain intentionally non-green unless their prerequisites, such as Metro, are present.

### How does interruption recovery work in this harness?

It detects interruption signals, classifies likely interruption type, and applies bounded recovery actions (for example `recover_to_known_state`) before continuing the flow.

### Is this a replacement for Appium or Maestro?

Not necessarily. It is better understood as an orchestration harness that can coexist with existing execution ecosystems while adding AI-oriented governance and diagnostics.

### Which scenarios are the best fit?

AI agents that need safe mobile device access, release-gate mobile regression, flaky-flow triage, AI-driven exploratory checks, and real-device CI workflows that require auditable, evidence-rich outcomes.

### What is the Explorer and when should I use it?

Explorer automatically traverses your app's screens without predefined flows. Use it when you need broad coverage discovery, want to map an unfamiliar app's navigation structure, or need to identify all reachable screens before writing targeted test flows. It is available via the `explore` CLI command.

Android physical-device Explorer evidence is tracked under `artifacts/explorer/android-full/2026-04-28T03-38-20/`: a full Settings traversal completed in 33m 50s with 45 pages, max depth 4, and 0 failures.

Validate that evidence offline with `pnpm run validate:explorer-android-evidence -- --min-pages 45 --min-depth 4`.

## Appium / Maestro vs This Harness

| Dimension | Appium / Maestro | Mobile E2E MCP Harness |
|---|---|---|
| Core role | Automation framework / flow runner | AI-facing orchestration harness |
| Execution strategy | Action execution centric | Deterministic-first + policy/session governance |
| Failure handling | Assertion/command failure outputs | Structured diagnostics + ranked causes + remediation hints |
| AI integration | Possible but not primary abstraction | Primary design target (tools for AI agents) |
| Evidence model | Varies by setup | Built-in evidence-first action outcomes |
| Helper app dependency | Required for iOS/Android replay | Android: owned-adb primary (no helper app needed for common commands); iOS simulator: axe CLI; iOS physical: WDA (one-time setup, see [External Tools Guide](docs/guides/external-tools.md)) |

## How It Works (End-to-End)

Typical runtime path:

1. Agent/client invokes an MCP tool via stdio or dev CLI.
2. MCP server validates input and applies policy checks.
3. Session context is resolved (or created), with lease/scheduling guardrails.
4. Adapter router selects deterministic execution path first.
5. Action executes and returns a structured result envelope.
6. Artifacts/evidence (screens, logs, summaries) are attached for audit/debug.
7. If deterministic resolution fails and policy allows it, bounded OCR/CV fallback is attempted.

This is why the project emphasizes **session + policy + evidence**, not only UI actions.

## High-Level Architecture

Reference split:

- **Control plane**: tool contracts, policy checks, session orchestration, audit/evidence indexing
- **Execution plane**: platform actions, UI resolution, retries, interruption handling, visual fallback

Architecture reference:

- [System architecture overview (Mermaid, in-repo)](docs/architecture/system-architecture-overview.md)
- [Reference architecture details](docs/architecture/architecture.md)
- [Architecture navigation index (zh-CN)](docs/architecture/README.zh-CN.md)

Source-of-truth note:

- Architecture docs describe both current baseline and target-state design.
- If a doc statement conflicts with strict validation behavior, prefer `packages/contracts/*.schema.json` and `configs/policies/*.yaml` for current enforced behavior.

## Capability Map (Current Scope)

- **Environment & device control** — discovery, lease/isolation, environment shaping
- **App lifecycle** — install/launch/terminate/reset/deep-link entry
- **Perception & interaction** — inspect/query UI, tap/type/wait, flow execution
- **Diagnostics & evidence** — logs, crash signals, performance, screenshot/timeline artifacts
- **Reliability & remediation** — reason-coded failures, bounded retries, remediation helpers

Tool registry/signature dispatch live in `packages/mcp-server/src/server.ts`, while descriptor metadata and wrapper composition live in `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts`.

## Complete MCP Tool Catalog (Current)

The server currently exposes **66 tools**. For AI agents, this is the current tool surface.

### 1) Session & lifecycle

`start_session`, `request_manual_handoff`, `end_session`, `run_flow`, `reset_app_state`

### 2) Task orchestration & flow capture

`execute_intent`, `complete_task`, `start_record_session`, `get_record_session_status`, `end_record_session`, `cancel_record_session`, `export_session_flow`, `record_task_flow`, `validate_flow`

### 3) Device & app control

`list_devices`, `install_app`, `launch_app`, `terminate_app`, `describe_capabilities`, `doctor`

### 4) UI perception, targeting, and interaction

`inspect_ui`, `query_ui`, `resolve_ui_target`, `scroll_only`, `scroll_and_resolve_ui_target`, `wait_for_ui`, `wait_for_ui_stable`, `tap`, `tap_element`, `scroll_and_tap_element`, `type_text`, `type_into_element`, `navigate_back`

### 5) Evidence, observability, and diagnostics

`take_screenshot`, `record_screen`, `get_logs`, `get_crash_signals`, `collect_diagnostics`, `collect_debug_evidence`, `get_screen_summary`, `get_session_state`, `get_page_context`, `capture_js_console_logs`, `capture_js_network_events`, `list_js_debug_targets`, `capture_element_screenshot`, `compare_visual_baseline`

### 6) Interruption handling

`detect_interruption`, `classify_interruption`, `resolve_interruption`, `resume_interrupted_action`

### 7) Failure analysis, recovery, and remediation

`perform_action_with_evidence`, `get_action_outcome`, `explain_last_failure`, `rank_failure_candidates`, `find_similar_failures`, `compare_against_baseline`, `recover_to_known_state`, `replay_last_stable_path`, `suggest_known_remediation`, `replay_checkpoint_chain`

### 8) Performance profiling

`measure_android_performance`, `measure_ios_performance`

### 9) Network diagnostics

`probe_network_readiness`, `diagnose_network_failure`, `inspect_network_policy`

`probe_network_readiness` checks runtime connectivity, DNS, latency, and optional backend reachability. `diagnose_network_failure` starts from an observed failed request and attributes likely Android cleartext or iOS ATS release-policy blockers. `inspect_network_policy` remains the lower-level static checker for plain HTTP endpoints using decoded manifest, network-security-config, Info.plist, or readable APK/IPA ZIP artifact evidence. These tools do not proxy traffic or mutate app configuration.

For exact signatures and supported inputs/outputs, use `packages/mcp-server/src/server.ts` (the tool registry source of truth).

## Deterministic Ladder and Fallback Policy

Action resolution order is intentional and strict:

1. Stable ID/resource-id/testID/accessibility identifier
2. Semantic tree match (text/label/role)
3. OCR text-region fallback (bounded)
4. CV/template fallback (bounded)
5. Fail with reason code + artifacts

Prohibited behavior:

- OCR/CV as the default first path
- Unbounded retries without state-change evidence
- Silent downgrade from deterministic to probabilistic execution

## Repository-Wide Principles

- **Deterministic-first**: use stable IDs/tree/native capabilities first; OCR/CV is bounded fallback.
- **Structured tool contracts**: return machine-consumable result envelopes (`status`, `reasonCode`, artifacts).
- **Session-oriented execution**: actions run in auditable sessions with explicit policy profiles.
- **Evidence-rich failures**: failures should carry enough context for explain/replay/remediation.

## Session, Policy, and Governance Model

- Sessions are auditable execution units with timeline and artifact references.
- Policy profiles can restrict tool classes (for example read-only vs interactive/full-control).
- Lease/scheduler constraints prevent unsafe concurrent execution on the same target.
- Redaction/governance paths exist to keep evidence useful while respecting data boundaries.

Key policy/config locations:

- `configs/policies/*.yaml`
- `configs/profiles/*.yaml`
- [Policy profile guide](docs/guides/policy-profiles.md)

## Non-Goals (Important for Correct Expectations)

- This is not a replacement for every mobile framework internals.
- This is not OCR-first automation.
- This does not imply separate full RN or Flutter backends, or immediate parity across all native/RN/Flutter edge cases.
- This is not a single abstraction that erases all platform differences.
