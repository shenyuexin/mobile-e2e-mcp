# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `mobile-e2e-mcp`.

## Development setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

For probe entrypoint changes, also run:

```bash
pnpm run validate:probe-dry-run
```

This validates the Android and iOS simulator probe contracts without requiring a real device or booted simulator.

## Branching and pull requests

1. Fork the repository and create a focused branch.
2. Keep each PR scoped to one problem.
3. Include tests or validation updates for behavior changes.
4. Ensure CI passes before requesting review.

## Coding expectations

- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions.
- Keep deterministic-first behavior and policy constraints intact.
- Do not introduce secret material or local artifacts into commits.
- If the change touches tools, contracts, adapter runtime, policy/session/evidence flows, platform support, or README capability claims, re-read `docs/engineering/ai-first-capability-expansion-guideline.md` in the current session before implementation.

## Commit and PR quality

- Write commit messages with both:
  - a concise semantic-style title (`type(scope): short summary` when applicable)
  - body text that explains **why** the change is needed and any important scope or workflow impact
- Avoid title-only commit messages for behavior, architecture, release, policy, CI, or developer-workflow changes.
- In PR description, include:
  - problem statement
  - approach and tradeoffs
  - validation evidence (`build`, `typecheck`, `test`)
