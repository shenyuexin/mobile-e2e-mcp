# Delivery Execution Index

## 1. Current Program State

- Current phase: Phase 3 real-run expansion + Phase 4/5 runtime hardening (in progress)
- Target completion date: TBD
- Next review checkpoint: self-hosted real-run review after GitHub runner evidence is collected for iOS / RN or the next supported sample

## 2. Owners and DRIs

| Governance/Security | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## 3. Blocking Decisions

| ADR | Decision | Owner | Due Date | Impacted Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADR-0001 | iOS backend choice | TBD | TBD | Phase 1 | Proposed |

## 4. Workstream Status

| Workstream | Status | Owner | Dependency | Evidence | Next Milestone |

## 6. Next Actions

1. Validate the next sample and the remaining iOS / React Native lanes against the Phase 3 real-run contract.
2. Broaden runtime governance enforcement beyond the current evidence-producing tools, including finer-grained redaction and retention execution.
3. Keep Phase 5 on bounded auto-remediation while designing the next controlled agentic integration step.
4. Use `docs/delivery/ai-first-implementation-plan.md` as the execution baseline for the next AI-first capability workstream.
