# Governance, Security, and Operations

## 1. Security Model

Define policy profiles:

- **Read-Only:** inspect tree, logs, screenshots only.
- **Interactive:** read + non-destructive UI actions.
- **Full-Control:** includes install/uninstall, permissions, data reset.

Each MCP tool declares required policy scope.

Current enforced baseline:

- access profiles are currently defined in `configs/policies/access-profiles.yaml`
- profile actions are coarse-grained but auditable
- unknown high-risk write actions should be treated as deny-by-default

Interruption orchestration governance scopes:

- `interrupt`: allows low-risk automatic interruption detection/classification/resolution.
- `interrupt-high-risk`: required for destructive interruption actions (for example destructive slot on action sheet).
- Unknown/high-risk interruption handling must remain auditable and policy-gated.

---

## 2. Access and Isolation

- Environment isolation: local-dev, CI, staging, pre-prod.
- Per-session credentials with TTL.
- Explicit device reservation and lock model.
- Secret redaction in logs and screenshots (PII handling).

Policy engine failure behavior should be fail-closed for destructive operations.

---

## 3. Audit Requirements

Every action should log:

- actor identity (agent/human)
- policy profile
- action input hash + normalized payload
- outcome + reason code
- artifact references
- timestamp and duration

---

## 4. Reliability SLOs

Suggested SLOs:

- Action success rate (deterministic path): >= 98%
- Median action latency: <= 1.2s (without OCR/CV)
- Failure packet completeness: >= 99%
- Session report generation: <= 5s post-run

---

## 5. Cost Controls

- Prefer on-device/local OCR before cloud OCR.
- Enable sampling for heavy artifacts in CI.
- Tiered retention: recent full artifacts, historical metadata.
- Parallelism quotas by environment and team.

---

## 6. Vision/OCR Usage Governance

Default behavior:

- Deterministic actions first.
- OCR/CV primarily for bounded fallback and diagnostics.

Policy requirements:

- Explicit permission scope to allow OCR-driven actioning.
- Confidence threshold and trace logging mandatory for OCR/CV actions.
- Automatic escalation/fail when confidence below threshold.

---

## 7. Model and Version Controls

- Pin OCR/CV model and configuration versions per environment.
- Record model/version in action telemetry and reports.
- Require approval workflow for model/config upgrades.

---

## 8. Artifact Retention and Redaction

- Define retention tiers by environment and data classification.
- Apply redaction policy for PII-sensitive screenshots/logs.
- Track retention exceptions with owner and expiry.

## 9. Scope Granularity Roadmap (P1)

To align with least-privilege best practices, evolve from coarse action scopes to finer controls:

- `record-screen`
- `diagnostics-export`
- `crash-export`
- `js-debug-read`
- `recovery-write`
- `ocr-action`
- `cv-action`

This roadmap should be reflected consistently in:

- `docs/architecture/policy-engine-runtime-architecture.zh-CN.md`
- tool-level scope mapping in server/tool docs
- policy regression tests
