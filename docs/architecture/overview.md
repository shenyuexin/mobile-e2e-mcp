# Comprehensive Mobile E2E MCP Blueprint (2026)

## 1. Objective

Design a **large-scale, extensible, AI-native mobile E2E MCP platform** that can:

1. Support iOS + Android across simulator/emulator and real devices.
2. Cover native apps, React Native apps, and Flutter apps.
3. Enable deterministic automation first, with OCR/CV as fallback.
4. Support both debugging and workflow automation.
5. Be delivered incrementally while preserving long-term architectural completeness.

---

## 2. Non-Goals (for early phases)

- Replacing Appium/Detox/Maestro internals.
- Building a custom device farm from scratch.
- OCR-first automation for all actions.
- A single abstraction that hides all platform differences.
- Full parity for all native/RN/Flutter/system-UI flows in initial release.

---

## 3. Design Principles

1. **Deterministic-first:** Prefer accessibility tree and native automation APIs.
2. **Adapter-based:** Separate control plane from platform/framework adapters.
3. **Session-oriented:** Every action occurs inside a reproducible, auditable session.
4. **Evidence-rich:** Every failure returns screenshot, tree snapshot, logs, and action timeline.
5. **Progressive fallback:** Tree → semantic matching → OCR → CV template → human escalation.
6. **Governed automation:** Fine-grained permissions and action policy by environment.
7. **AUT contract first:** Determinism requires app-side testability contracts.

---

## 4. Core Value Proposition

Instead of providing only low-level wrappers, this platform acts as a **universal AI orchestration layer for mobile testing and debugging**, with:

- Multi-backend execution routing.
- Standardized tool contracts for AI agents.
- Built-in reliability controls and flakiness mitigation.
- Reviewable audit and governance model.

---

## 5. Why This Is Timely in 2026

- MCP ecosystem maturity and adoption are increasing across agent platforms.
- Mobile automation backends (Appium/WDA/idb/Detox/Maestro) are mature enough for composition.
- Teams need an MxN integration reduction: multiple agents × multiple mobile backends.

The technical challenge has shifted from "can automation run" to "can agentic automation run reliably, safely, and at scale."

---

## 6. Definition of Execution Readiness

An app is "execution-ready" for this MCP platform only when:

1. Stable identifiers/semantics are available for critical elements.
2. Deterministic entry points exist (deep links or test hooks).
3. Reset semantics are defined (data/session/environment reset).
4. Core flow pass criteria and artifact requirements are accepted.
5. Policy profile and environment constraints are configured.

---

## 7. AUT Contract (Summary)

Minimum app-under-test contract expectations:

- Stable test IDs/accessibility identifiers for critical controls.
- Predictable loading and ready-state conventions.
- Deep-link or test-entry support for core screens.
- Deterministic reset and seed-data strategy.
- Framework-specific instrumentation profile compliance.

## 8. Focused Architecture Notes

- React Native debugger sequence and capability gap: [`docs/architecture/rn-debugger-sequence.md`](./rn-debugger-sequence.md)
- AI-first capability model: [`docs/architecture/ai-first-capability-model.md`](./ai-first-capability-model.md)
