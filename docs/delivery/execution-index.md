## 5. Evidence Links

- Phase review packet: docs/phases/phase-1-closeout.zh-CN.md, docs/phases/phase-2-closeout.zh-CN.md
- CI baseline: TBD
- Flakiness baseline: artifacts/phase1-ios/ and artifacts/phase1-android/
- Security checklist report: TBD

## 6. Next Actions

1. Validate the next sample against Phase 3 profile contracts and compatibility targets.
2. Start wiring governance baselines into runtime enforcement checkpoints.
3. Keep agentic baselines as configuration contracts until runtime integration exists.
4. Use `docs/delivery/ai-first-implementation-plan.md` as the execution baseline for the next AI-first capability workstream.
