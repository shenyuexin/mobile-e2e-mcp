# Tests

This directory is reserved for:

- contract validation
- integration checks for scripts and MCP tools
- reusable test fixtures

Current committed fixtures:

- `tests/fixtures/ui/android-cart.xml` - stable Android hierarchy sample for parsing/query/action tests
- `tests/fixtures/ui/ios-sample.json` - stable iOS hierarchy sample for partial-support summary tests

Current no-device regression layers:

- `packages/adapter-maestro/test/ui-model.test.ts` - fixture-driven parsing/query/bounds checks plus adapter-level envelope coverage for the new UI tools
- `packages/mcp-server/test/server.test.ts` - server registry and invoke smoke coverage
- `packages/mcp-server/test/stdio-server.test.ts` - stdio initialize/list/call and error-path coverage
- `packages/mcp-server/test/dev-cli.test.ts` - CLI argument parsing and dry-run dispatch coverage
- `scripts/validate-dry-run.ts` - top-level asserted dry-run validator that spawns the real CLI commands and checks returned JSON semantics

Capability discovery coverage now also lives in the same stack:

- adapter-level profile building and discovery results
- server/stdio/dev-cli smoke coverage for `describe_capabilities`
- root dry-run validation for session-attached capabilities and explicit capability discovery
